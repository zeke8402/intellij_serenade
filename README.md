# Theme Discontinued
Jetbrains requires this plugin to be manually compiled and resubmitted for review for every minor version change, despite none of the code changing whatsoever.
Because of this, I have decided to discontinue the development of this plugin. Should there come a time when maintaining a simple theme isn't unmanageable, I may support it.
